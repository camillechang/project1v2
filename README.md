# My Personal Website
This project is my personal website.  The current implementation is to use the simplest HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT. In the future, more content will be added to create a place where I write my own technical articles, where others can comment and show the projects I have done. At the same time technically, react, typescript and sass will also be used.



## To do List
- Refactor the code of the entire website
- Add more to support responsive design.
- Add blog part for technical articles.
- Add github comment support.
- My previous projects showcase.
- More fancy tech stack.
